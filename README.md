JPT is organized into several packages as follows:
* __org.cicirello.permutations__: Currently just the Permutation class.
    + __org.cicirello.permutations.distance__: Collection of permutation distance metric implementations.
* org.cicirello.math
    + __org.cicirello.math.la__: Linear algebra related classes.
    + __org.cicirello.math.stats__: Statistics related classes.

Javadoc documentation is in the /docs folder or at https://jpt.cicirello.org/

Source code is found in the /src folder.

Compiled jar files of the library are in the /lib folder

The folder /replication contains code for replicating data from research publications.
It currently has one subfolder jss which includes the source code, and executable jar file
to generate the data from a paper recently submitted to the Journal of Statistical Software.
If you are a reviewer of that paper, please see the readme.txt in the /replication/jss folder.
