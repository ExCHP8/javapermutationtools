Examples Directory Readme:

The source for examples is contained in this directory, and
currently includes the following examples:

org.cicirello.examples.jpt.AverageDistance
org.cicirello.examples.jpt.TableOfDistances

Read the comments in the source for a description of what they
demonstrate, etc.

Make sure the jar file of the library is in your classpath when
you compile and/or run any of these. Specifically, make sure jpt1.jar is in your
classpath (or any later version--I intend to ensure later versions
are backwards compatible).
