Replication Directory Readme:

This directory contains source code to replicate data and/or experimental
results from publications that have used this library.  It currently includes
the following:

org.cicirello.replication.ieeetevc2016.FDC: This program generates the fitness 
distance correlations for the "Permutation in a Haystack" fitness landscapes 
found in Table II of the paper:
V.A. Cicirello, "The Permutation in a Haystack Problem and the Calculus of Search Landscapes," 
IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20(3):434-446, June 2016.

Although the replication programs are commented, to fully understand what it is that
they compute, you will likely need to consult the relevant publications.

Make sure the jar file of the library is in your classpath when
you compile and/or run any of these. Specifically, make sure jpt1.jar is in your
classpath (or any later version--I intend to ensure later versions
are backwards compatible).
