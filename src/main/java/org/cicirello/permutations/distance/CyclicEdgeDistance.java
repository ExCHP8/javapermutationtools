/**
 * Cyclic edge distance treats the permutations as if they represent sets of edges, and counts the
 * number of edges that differ. It treats the last to the first element as an edge.
 *
 * <p>Consider the example permutation: [1, 5, 2, 4, 0, 3]. Cyclic edge distance treats this as
 * equivalent to the set of undirected edges: {(1,5), (5,2), (2,4), (4,0), (0,3), (3,1)}.
 *
 * <p>E.g., distance between [1, 5, 2, 4, 0, 3] and [ 5, 1, 4, 0, 3, 2] is 3. Why? Well, the first
 * permutation has the edges: {(1,5), (5,2), (2,4), (4,0), (0,3), (3,1)}. The second has three of
 * these (5,1), which is the same as (1,5) since they are undirected edges, (4,0), and (0,3), but
 * does not include 3 of the edges: (5,2), (2,4), (3,1)
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n), where n is the permutation length.
 *
 * <p>Cyclic edge distance was first described in:<br>
 * S. Ronald, "Distance functions for order-based encodings," in Proc. IEEE CEC. IEEE Press, 1997,
 * pp. 49â€“54.
