/**
 * Normalized Deviation distance is the sum of the positional deviation of the permutation elements
 * divided by N-1 (where N is the length of the permutation). The positional deviation of an element
 * is the difference in its location in the two permutations. Normalizing by dividing by N-1 causes
 * each element's contribution to distance to be in the interval [0,1].
 *
 * <p>For example, consider p1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and p2 = [1, 0, 5, 2, 4, 3]. Element 0 is
 * displaced by 1 position. Likewise for elements 1 and 2. Element 3 is displaced by 2 positions.
 * Element 4 is in the same position in both. Element 5 is displaced by 3 positions.
 *
 * <p>Sum the deviations: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 3 = 8.
 *
 * <p>The length is 6. So, normalized deviation distance is 8 / (6-1) = 1.6.
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n), where n is the permutation length.
 *
 * <p>Normalized deviation distance was introduced in:<br>
 * S. Ronald, "More distance functions for order-based encodings," in Proc. IEEE CEC. IEEE Press,
 * 1998, pp. 558â€“563.
