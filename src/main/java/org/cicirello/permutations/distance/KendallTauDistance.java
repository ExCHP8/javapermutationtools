/**
 * Kendall Tau distance is sometimes also known as bubble sort distance, as it is the number of
 * adjacent swaps necessary to transform one permutation into the other.
 *
 * <p>Another way of describing it is the number of pairs of elements whose order is inverted in one
 * permutation relative to the other.
 *
 * <p>For example, consider p1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and p2 = [0, 3, 2, 1, 4]. The length is 5, so there
 * are a total of 5*4/2 = 10 pairs of elements. 0 precedes all of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in both
 * permutations. However, 1 precedes 2, 3, and 4 in p1, but only 4 in p2, so 2 adjacent swaps are
 * needed for element 1. Elements 2 and 3 are in one order in p1, but switched in p2 relative to p1.
 * So a total of 3 adjacent swaps are needed to transform p1 to p2. Kendall Tau distance is thus 3.
 *
 * <p>Kendall originally normalized the distance, but more recently many do not. Our implementation
 * does not normalize.
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n lg n), where n is the permutation length. This runtime is achieved using a
 * modified version of mergesort to count the inversions.
 *
 * <p>Kendall Tau distance originally described in:<br>
 * M. G. Kendall, "A new measure of rank correlation," Biometrika, vol. 30, no. 1/2, pp. 81â€“93, June
 * 1938.
