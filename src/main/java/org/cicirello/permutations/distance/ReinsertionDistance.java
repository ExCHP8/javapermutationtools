/**
 * <p>Reinsertion distance is the count of the number of removal/reinsertion operations
 * needed to transform one permutation into the other.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This implementation utilizes the observation that the elements that must be removed and reinserted
 * are exactly those elements that are not in the longest common subsequence.</p>
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n lg n), where n is the permutation length.</p>
 *
 * <p>Reinsertion distance more generally was described in:<br>
 * V. A. Cicirello and R. Cernera, <a href="https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2013flairs.html" target=_top>"Profiling the distance characteristics 
 * of mutation operators for permutation-based genetic algorithms,"</a> 
 * in Proceedings of the 26th FLAIRS Conference. AAAI Press, May 2013, pp. 46â€“51.</p> 
 *
 * <p>However, in that paper, it was computed, in O(n^2) time, using an adaptation of string Edit Distance.</p>
 *
 * <p>For description of computing it using the length of the longest common subsequence, see:<br> 
 * V.A. Cicirello, <a href="https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2016evc.html" target=_top>"The Permutation in a Haystack Problem 
 * and the Calculus of Search Landscapes,"</a> 
 * IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20(3):434-446, June 2016.</p>
 *
 * <p>However, that paper used an O(n^2) time algorithm for longest common subsequence.  This class has been
 * updated to use a more efficient O(n lg n) algorithm for longest common subsequence.  It is a version of
 * Hunt et al's algorithm 
 * that has been optimized to assume permutations of the integers in [0, (n-1)] with unique elements.
 * The original algorithm of Hunt et al was for general strings that could contain duplicates and which could consist 
 * of characters of any alphabet.  In that more general case, O(n lg n) was the best case runtime.  In our
 * special case, O(n lg n) is worst case runtime.</p>
 *
 * <p>See the following for complete details of Hunt et al's algorithm for longest common subsequence:<br>
 * J.W. Hunt and T.G. Szymanski, "A fast algorithm for computing longest common subsequences," 
 * Communications of the ACM, 20(5):350-353, May, 1977.</p>
