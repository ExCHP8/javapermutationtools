/**
 * Reversal Distance is the minimum number of subpermutation reversals necessary to transform one
 * permutation into the other. This is an NP-Hard problem.
 *
 * <p>Our original motivation for implementing this required computing reversal distance from a
 * target permutation for all permutations of that target. Therefore, we were going to exhaust all
 * N! permutations of an N element list regardless of how we computed this.
 *
 * <p>Therefore, the approach taken in this implementation is to compute a lookup table with N!
 * elements, one for each of the N! possible permutations. The lookup table maps permutations to
 * distances. The distances are computed using a breadth first enumeration outward from the
 * permutation [0, 1, ..., (N-1)]. The starting permutation is distance 0 from itself. The N*(N-1)/2
 * permutations that are derived by reversing a subpermutation are a distance of 1 from the initial
 * permutation. And we continue in this manner, computing all that are a distance of 2, and then 3,
 * etc.
 *
 * <p>The total cost of this is: O(N! * N^3) since each permutation has N^2 neighbors, generating a
 * neighbor is linear cost, and there are N! permutations. Since our original application required
 * computing distance for all N! permutations, the amortized cost (if your application also has that
 * requirement) of computing distance is O(N^3).
 *
 * <p>We have not used this for N &gt; 10. Warning: time to construct distance measure increases
 * factorially.
