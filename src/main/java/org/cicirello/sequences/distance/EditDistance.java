/**
 * EditDistance is an implementation of Wagner and Fischer's dynamic programming algorithm for
 * computing string edit distance.
 *
 * <p>Edit distance is the minimum cost to transform one string (or sequence) into the other, which
 * is the sum of the costs of the edit operations necessary to do so. This edit distance considers 3
 * edit operations: Inserts which inserts a new element into the sequence, Deletes which removes an
 * element from the sequence, and Changes which replace an element with a different element.
 *
 * <p>The edit distance is parameterized by costs for the edit operations. The class provides a
 * constructor which enables you to specify 3 costs as ints, 1 for each type of edit operation. If
 * your application requires non-integer costs, then use the {@link EditDistanceDouble} class which
 * defines the costs as doubles, but is otherwise an implementation of the same algorithm.
 *
 * <p>This class supports computing EditDistance for Java String objects or arrays of any of the
 * primitive types, or arrays of objects. It makes no assumptions about the contents of the Strings
 * or arrays, and they can contain duplicates, or can be such that some elements only appear in one
 * or the other of the sequences, or can be of different lengths.
 *
 * <p>Another class (with same name but in different package) is available if you need to compute
 * distance specifically between permutations, rather than general sequences. That class is the
 * {@link org.cicirello.permutations.distance.EditDistance} class which computes distance between
 * permutations of the integers from 0 to N-1.
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n*m), where n and m are the lengths of the two sequences (i.e., Strings or arrays).
 *
 * <p>Wagner and Fischer's String Edit Distance was introduced in:<br>
 * R. A. Wagner and M. J. Fischer, "The string-to-string correction problem," Journal of the ACM,
 * vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 168â€“173, January 1974.
