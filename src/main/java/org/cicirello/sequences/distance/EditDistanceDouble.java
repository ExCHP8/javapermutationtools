/**
 * EditDistanceDouble is an implementation of Wagner and Fischer's dynamic programming algorithm for
 * computing string edit distance. This class supports double-valued costs, while the {@link
 * EditDistance} class supports int-valued costs. If your costs are int-valued, the {@link
 * EditDistance} class may be slightly faster, but not asymptotically faster.
 *
 * <p>Edit distance is the minimum cost to transform one string (or sequence) into the other, which
 * is the sum of the costs of the edit operations necessary to do so. This edit distance considers 3
 * edit operations: Inserts which insert a new element into the sequence, Deletes which remove an
 * element from the sequence, and Changes which replace an element with a different element.
 *
 * <p>The edit distance is parameterized by costs for the edit operations. The constructor enables
 * you to specify 3 costs as values of type double, 1 for each type of edit operation.
 *
 * <p>This class supports computing edit distance for Java String objects or arrays of any of the
 * primitive types, or arrays of objects. It makes no assumptions about the contents of the Strings
 * or arrays, and they can contain duplicates, or can be such that some elements only appear in one
 * or the other of the sequences, or can be of different lengths.
 *
 * <p>Another class, {@link org.cicirello.permutations.distance.EditDistance}, is available if you
 * need to compute distance specifically between permutations, rather than general sequences. That
 * class computes distance between permutations of the integers from 0 to N-1.
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n*m), where n and m are the lengths of the two sequences (i.e., Strings or arrays).
 *
 * <p>Wagner and Fischer's String Edit Distance was introduced in:<br>
 * R. A. Wagner and M. J. Fischer, "The string-to-string correction problem," Journal of the ACM,
 * vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 168â€“173, January 1974.
