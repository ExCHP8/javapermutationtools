/**
 * Cyclic Edge Distance:
 *
 * <p>Cyclic edge distance treats the permutations as if they represent sets of edges, and counts
 * the number of edges that differ.  It treats the last to the first element as an edge.</p>
 *
 * <p>Consider the example permutation: [1, 5, 2, 4, 0, 3]. 
 * Cyclic edge distance treats this as equivalent to the set of undirected edges:
 * {(1,5), (5,2), (2,4), (4,0), (0,3), (3,1)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>E.g., distance between [1, 5, 2, 4, 0, 3] and [ 5, 1, 4, 0, 3, 2] is 3.
 * Why? Well, the first permutation has the edges: {(1,5), (5,2), (2,4), (4,0), (0,3), (3,1)}.
 * The second has three of these (5,1), which is the same as (1,5) since they are undirected edges, (4,0), and (0,3),
 * but does not include 3 of the edges: (5,2), (2,4), (3,1)</p>
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n), where n is the permutation length.</p>
 *
 * <p>Cyclic edge distance was first described in:<br>
 * S. Ronald, "Distance functions for order-based encodings," in Proc. IEEE CEC. IEEE Press, 1997, pp. 49â€“54.</p>
