/**
 * Deviation Distance:
 *
 * <p>Deviation distance is the sum of the positional deviation of the permutation elements.
 * The positional deviation of an element is the difference in its location in the two
 * permutations.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example, consider p1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and p2 = [1, 0, 5, 2, 4, 3].
 * Element 0 is displaced by 1 position.  Likewise for elements 1 and 2.
 * Element 3 is displaced by 2 positions.
 * Element 4 is in the same position in both.
 * Element 5 is displaced by 3 positions.</p> 
 *
 * <p>Sum the deviations: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 3 = 8.  And that is the distance.</p>
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n), where n is the permutation length.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Deviation distance was introduced in:<br>
 * S. Ronald, "More distance functions for order-based encodings," in Proc. IEEE CEC. IEEE Press, 1998, pp. 558â€“563.</p>
