/**
 * Normalized Deviation Distance:
 *
 * <p>Normalized Deviation distance is the sum of the positional deviation of the permutation elements
 * divided by N-1 (where N is the length of the permutation).
 * The positional deviation of an element is the difference in its location in the two
 * permutations.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example, consider p1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and p2 = [1, 0, 5, 2, 4, 3].
 * Element 0 is displaced by 1 position.  Likewise for elements 1 and 2.
 * Element 3 is displaced by 2 positions.
 * Element 4 is in the same position in both.
 * Element 5 is displaced by 3 positions.</p> 
 *
 * <p>Sum the deviations: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 3 = 8.</p>  
 *
 * <p>The length is 6.  So, normalized deviation distance is 8 / 6 = 1.3333.</p>
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n), where n is the permutation length.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Normalized deviation distance was introduced in the following (although they simply
 * referred to it as deviation distance):<br>
 *  V. Campos, M. Laguna, and R. Marti, "Context-independent scatter and tabu search for permutation problems," 
 *  INFORMS Journal on Computing, vol. 17, no. 1, pp. 111â€“122, 2005.</p>
