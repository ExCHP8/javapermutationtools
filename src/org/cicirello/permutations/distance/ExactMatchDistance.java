/**
 * Exact Match Distance:
 *
 * <p>Exact Match distance is an extension of Hamming distance but to non-binary strings, in this case, permutations.
 * It is the count of the number of positions for which the two permutations contain different elements.</p>
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n), where n is the permutation length.</p>
 *
 * <p>Exact match distance was introduced in:<br>
 * S. Ronald, "More distance functions for order-based encodings," in Proc. IEEE CEC. IEEE Press, 1998, pp. 558â€“563.</p>
