/**
 * Kendall Tau Distance:
 *
 * <p>Kendall Tau distance is sometimes also known as bubble sort distance, as it is
 * the number of adjacent swaps necessary to transform one permutation into the other.</p>
 *
 * <p>Another way of describing it is the number of pairs of elements whose order is opposite
 * in one permutation relative to the other.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For example, consider p1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and p2 = [0, 3, 2, 1, 4].
 * The length is 5, so there are a total of 5*4/2 = 10 pairs of elements.
 * 0 precedes all of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in both permutations.
 * However, 1 precedes 2, 3, and 4 in p1, but only 4 in p2, so 2 adjacent swaps are needed for element 1.
 * Elements 2 and 3 are in one order in p1, but switched in p2 relative to p1.
 * So a total of 3 adjacent swaps are needed to transform p1 to p2.  Kendall Tau distance is thus 3.</p>
 *
 * <p>Kendall originally normalized the distance, but more recently many do not.  Our implementation does not normalize.</p>
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n^2), where n is the permutation length.</p>
 *
 * <p>Kendall Tau distance originally described in:<br>
 * M. G. Kendall, "A new measure of rank correlation," Biometrika, vol. 30, no. 1/2, pp. 81â€“93, June 1938.</p>
