 /**
 * RType Distance:
 *
 * <p>RType distance treats the permutations as if they represent sets of directed edges, and counts
 * the number of edges that differ.</p>
 *
 * <p>Consider the example permutation: [1, 5, 2, 4, 0, 3]. 
 * RType distance treats this as equivalent to the set of directed edges:
 * {(1,5), (5,2), (2,4), (4,0), (0,3)}.</p> 
 *
 * <p>E.g., distance between [1, 5, 2, 4, 0, 3] and [ 5, 1, 4, 0, 3, 2] is 3.
 * Why? Well, the first permutation has the directed edges: {(1,5), (5,2), (2,4), (4,0), (0,3)}.
 * The second has 2 of these (4,0), and (0,3),
 * but does not include 3 of the edges: (1,5), (5,2), (2,4)</p>
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n), where n is the permutation length.</p>
 *
 * <p>RType distance was introduced in:<br>
 * V. Campos, M. Laguna, and R. Marti, "Context-independent scatter and tabu search for permutation problems," 
 * INFORMS Journal on Computing, vol. 17, no. 1, pp. 111â€“122, 2005.</p>
