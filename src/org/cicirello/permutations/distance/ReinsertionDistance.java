/**
 * Reinsertion Distance:
 *
 * <p>Reinsertion distance is the count of the number of removal/reinsertion operations
 * needed to transform one permutation into the other.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This implementation utilizes the observation that the elements that must be removed and reinserted
 * are exactly those elements that are not in the longest common subsequence.</p>
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n^2), where n is the permutation length.</p>
 *
 * <p>Reinsertion distance more generally was described in:<br>
 * V. A. Cicirello and R. Cernera, <a href="https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2013flairs.html" target=_top>"Profiling the distance characteristics 
 * of mutation operators for permutation-based genetic algorithms,"</a> 
 * in Proceedings of the 26th FLAIRS Conference. AAAI Press, May 2013, pp. 46â€“51.</p> 
 *
 * <p>However, in that paper, it was computed using an adaptation of string Edit Distance.</p>
 *
 * <p>For description of computing it using the length of the longest common subsequence, see:<br> 
 * V.A. Cicirello, <a href="https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2016evc.html" target=_top>"The Permutation in a Haystack Problem
