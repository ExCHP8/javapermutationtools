/**
 * <p>EditDistance is an implementation of Wagner and Fischer's dynamic programming algorithm for computing string edit distance.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Edit distance is the minimum cost to transform one string (or sequence) into the other, which is the sum of the costs
 * of the edit operations necessary to do so.  This edit distance considers 3 edit operations:
 * Inserts which insert a new element into the sequence, Deletes which remove an element from the sequence, and
 * Changes which replace an element with a different element.</p>
 *
 * <p>The edit distance is parameterized by costs for the edit operations.  We provide two constructors which enable you to specify
 * 3 costs, 1 for each type of edit operation.  One of the constructors expects integer costs, and the other double valued costs.
 * If you specify costs as integers, then all of the distance and distancef methods from the 
 * {@link org.cicirello.sequences.distance.SequenceDistanceMeasurer SequenceDistanceMeasurer} 
 * and {@link org.cicirello.sequences.distance.SequenceDistanceMeasurerDouble SequenceDistanceMeasurerDouble} 
 * interfaces are available.  If costs are specified as doubles, then
 * only the distancef methods will function, while the distance methods will throw exceptions.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class supports computing EditDistance for Java String objects or arrays of any of the primitive types, or arrays of objects.  It makes no assumptions
 * about the contents of the Strings or arrays, and they can contain duplicates, or can be such that some elements only appear in one or
 * the other of the sequences, or can be of different lengths.</p>
 *
 * <p>Another class (with same name but in different package) is available if you need to compute distance specifically between permutations,
 * rather than general sequences.  That class is the {@link org.cicirello.permutations.distance.EditDistance} class which computes distance between permutations
 * of the integers from 0 to N-1.</p> 
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n*m), where n and m are the lengths of the two sequences (i.e., Strings or arrays).</p> 
 *
 * <p>Wagner and Fischer's String Edit Distance was introduced in:<br>
 * R. A. Wagner and M. J. Fischer, "The string-to-string correction problem," Journal of the ACM, vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 168â€“173, January 1974.</p>
