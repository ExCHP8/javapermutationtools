/**
 * <p>ExactMatch distance (or Hamming Distance) of a pair of non-binary strings (or more generally sequences) is the number of
 * sequence (or string) positions where the two sequences differ. 
 * This class supports comparison of Java String objects,
 * as well as comparisons of arrays of any of Java's eight primitive types, and arrays of any object type. 
 * It is the count of the number of positions for which the two sequences contain different elements.</p>
 *
 * <p>Most other implementations of Hamming distance require the two strings to be of the same length.  Ours does not.
 * If the two sequences (i.e., arrays or Strings) are of different lengths, then the difference in length affects
 * distance.  E.g., although "abbd" is a distance of 1 from "abcd" since they differ in one position, "abbd" is a distance of 4 from "abcdefg"
 * (the one difference, plus the three extra characters).</p>
 *
 * <p>Runtime: O(n), where n is the length of the shorter of the two sequences.</p>
 *
 * <p>If your sequences are guaranteed not to have duplicates, and to contain the same set of elements, then consider instead using the
 * {@link org.cicirello.permutations.distance.ExactMatchDistance} class, which assumes permutations of the integers from 0 to N-1.</p>
 *
 * <p>Exact match distance was introduced specifically for permutations in:<br>
 * S. Ronald, "More distance functions for order-based encodings," in Proc. IEEE CEC. IEEE Press, 1998, pp. 558â€“563.</p>
