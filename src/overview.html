<p>The JavaPermutationTools (JPT) API provides Java classes for computation on
permutations and sequences.  The current release enables representing 
and generating permutations, implementations of a variety of permutation 
distance metrics, as well as sequence distance metrics.  The sequence distance
metrics support computing the distance between pairs of Strings, arrays of primitive values,
as well as arrays of objects.  More computation on permutations
will be added in later releases.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cicirello/JavaPermutationTools" target=_top>source code repository</a> 
is hosted on GitHub, and includes the source code, example programs, as well as programs 
that reproduce results from published research papers that have either used this API or 
earlier unreleased versions of it.  The source code is licensed under the
