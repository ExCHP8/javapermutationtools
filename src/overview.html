<p>The JavaPermutationTools (JPT) API provides Java classes that enable representing 
and generating permutations, as well as performing computation on permutations. This 
initial release primarily consists of implementations of a variety of permutation 
distance metrics. More computation on permutations will be added in later releases.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cicirello/JavaPermutationTools" target=_top>source code repository</a> 
is hosted on GitHub, and includes the source code, example programs, as well as programs 
that reproduce results from published research papers that have either used this API or 
earlier unreleased versions of it.  The source code is licensed under the 
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html" target=_top>GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3)</a>.</p>
