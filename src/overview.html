<p>JavaPermutationTools (JPT) is a Java 
library for representing and generating permutations and sequences, as well as performing 
computation on permutations and sequences. This includes implementations of a variety of 
permutation distance metrics as well as distance metrics on sequences (i.e., Strings, arrays, 
and other ordered data types).</p>

to <a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.cicirello/jpt" target=_top>Maven Central</a>, 
from which it is easily imported into software projects using Maven and other 
commonly used build tools.  Additionally, there is a 
GitHub <a href="https://github.com/cicirello/jpt-examples" target=_top>repository of 
example programs</a> that show basic usage of the JPT library, as well as replication programs that 
reproduce results found in published papers.</p>
